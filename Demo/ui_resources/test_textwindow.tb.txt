				"The menu to the left spawns some examples of what tinkerbell can do.\n\n" \

				"<color #0794f8>Some things to try out</color>\n" \
				" • All layouts provide panning of content automatically when squashed below the minimal size, so try resizing windows and pan.\n" \
				" • Lines starting with a bullet sequence (like this one) should wrap in a smart way.\n" \
				" • Message windows whose target is removed, are automatically removed. Close the menu window with open messages.\n" \
				" • Keyboard navigation using tab.\n" \
				" • <u>Underline</u>, <color #f44>Red</color>, <color #6f6>Green</color>, <color #aaf>Blue</color>\n\n" \
				"<color #0794f8>Good to know</color>\n" \
				" • The text component you're reading in handles styling and embedded content (such as this widget: <widget TBButton: text: ':)'>), but does not handle editing of those fully. Undo/Redo should work fine, but caret movement and position updates doesn't.\n" \
				" • All resources are UTF-8."
