Tinkerbell Integration guide
-----------------------------

This is a short guide to integrating tinkerbell in a game or application.
It basically list what you most probably want to do.
More details is found in the method definitions.

Input
-----

You need to create a "root widget" for your UI widgets. A Widget that act
as receiver for input, painting etc, and is parent to your other widgets.
Tinkerbell will handle input capture, focus, etc. automatically.

List of input triggers (root is your root Widget):

	root->InvokePointer[Down/Up/Move] - Mouse or touch input.
	root->InvokeWheel                 - Mouse wheel input
	root->InvokeKey                   - Keyboard input

Layout & Painting
-----------------

Before painting, it is a good time to update widgets input states and layouts
that might affect the rendering. This is done by calling:

	root->InvokeProcessStates
	root->InvokeProcess

Before painting the root widget (and all its children), you need to prepare
the renderer to set up the correct matrix etc.

	g_renderer->BeginPaint(window_width, window_height);
	root->InvokePaint(Widget::PaintProps())
	g_renderer->EndPaint();

Message handling
----------------

TBMessageHandler::ProcessMessages() needs to be called frequently to process
the message queue.

If you have a game running its loop continuously, you can just call ProcessMessages()
each time.

If you have a event driven application that should only consume CPU when needed
you can call TBMessageHandler::GetNextMessageFireTime() for scheduleing when to run
ProcessMessage next. Also, TBSystem::RescheduleTimer will be called back if the time
it needs to run next is changed.

Rendering
---------

There is already a OpenGL renderer implementation, using fixed function pipeline.

TBBitmap   - FIX: write something here.
TBRenderer - FIX: write something here.

Some apps need to unload all graphics and reload it again, f.ex when the app
is put to sleep in the background. Tinkerbell loads all its bitmaps through the skin,
so unloading & reloading all textures can be done with:

	g_tb_skin->UnloadBitmaps()
	g_tb_skin->ReloadBitmaps()

Font system
-----------

There is font implementations for freetype and stb_truetype.h, and a bitmap font
system (tbbf - "tinker bell bitmap font") that is very simple to use and supports
any range or characters, glow & shadow. You can choose any of theese or add your own.

The implementation API render glyph by glyph, but if it's requested to externalize
the entire string measuring & drawing, support for that shouldn't be hard to add.

System integration
------------------

TBImageLoader - FIX: write something here. (+TDImage)

TBSystem - Needs to be implemented for timers & some settings.

TBClipboard - Needs to be implemented for clipboard support.

TBFile - Needs to be implemented for file loading.
